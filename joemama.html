      <h2><b><u>1. Information about this website</u></b></h2>
      <p> Welcome to my first website I've ever made. The reason why I made it, is to learn next to programming languages like python, this markup language aka HTML. It'll surely be useful for school, later university and future job. If you check this website out during a long time, you might be able to notice changes, since I try to improve my HTML knowledge and maybe intergrate CSS and javascript as well into this site.<br>For now it looks pretty basic probably like a website before I even was born before 2004, but hopefully my overtime improving HTML / CSS / and javascript knowledge will help me making this website look professional.</p>
